# Cavity-test-in-python
This program was made to do mod-dependent changing of Q(loaded)-factor of the cavity for ESR

NetworkAnalyzer - send settings to network analyzer, get data from it, write to file.

Potentiometer - just changing the resistance.

In the end we should have Q(load) as function of R, nice plot. 

Have fun...
